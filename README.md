run this command on a terminal: 

    python rmTyping.py path-to-the-target-file

to remove type hinting to make the file runnable on the lower versions of python

if it throws an error or is stuck in a loop, it's maybe because there's a syntax error in the target file

rmTypingWithTypeHinting.py file contains a lot of type hinting, so run

    python rmTyping.py rmTypingWithTypeHinting.py

to see if the code works on your computer.
